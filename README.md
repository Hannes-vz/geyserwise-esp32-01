# Geyserwise simple button press with esp-01

Use [esp-01 from aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004626018608.html) or [esp-01 from Micro robotics](https://www.robotics.org.za/ESP-01?search=esp) to trigger red pin on geyserwise with the option of adding temperature reading.

## Esp firmware

I used this guide from [sigmdel](https://www.sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/esp8266/ESP01_AT_Firmware_en.html#v175) to install the firmware on esp-01


## Esp Home setup

Installed [esp home](https://www.esphome.io/components/esp8266) on esp-01

**Here is the my config file for esp home:**
```yaml
esphome:
  name: esp
  friendly_name: esp
  on_boot:
    then:
      switch.turn_off: geyserswitch #Ensures that the default state is off.

#Take note of the board type.

  board: esp07
  restore_from_flash: true

Take note you don't need to usd mqtt. I just used it for the grid_frequency because it clashes with the homeassistant api.
The sunsynk monitoring project I used you can find on [powerforum](https://powerforum.co.za/topic/8451-sunsynk-inverter-monitoring/page/29/#comment-197235)

## Circuit Diagrams

## Analog pin breakout

I searched for a way to read analog signals but the esp8266 chip on the esp-01 does not provide it by default.
After searching in the documentation I found an analog pin that you can access by bridging it out with 26 awg wire.

### Documentation

![Soldering](https://github.com/Hannes-vz/geyserwise-esp32-01/blob/main/Pictures/Solderingexample.jpg)

## Geyser on/off detection

The yellow wire pulls high when the geyser element is turned on. Connect wire to the pin to read the state of the geyser element.

## Temperature detection

The esp8266 chip analog toup pin can only read voltages between 0V - 1V. I lowered the voltage by making a voltage divider as shown in the schematic diagram.
I setup my phone camera to record the voltage the esp-01 is reading at a certain time and the temperature displayed on the geyserwise. 
And just set the datapoints in the esphome config. Tried using simple linear function, it was highly inaccurate.


## Final circuit

Relay is probably not necessary, but I used it just make make sure I don't blow something.
The orange wire is the ground wire.
The blue wire is the geyser element state detection.
